# BrandFlow — Project Status & Handoff

**Living document. Update this at the end of every work session.**
Last updated: 2026-07-07

This is the single source of truth for *current state*. The numbered docs
(01–16) are the *design/spec*; this file records what is actually built,
what is stubbed, the known gotchas, and what to do next.

---

## 1. What BrandFlow is (one paragraph)

A multi-tenant SaaS that turns a content idea into a finished, on-brand
LinkedIn post — AI writes the copy, an AI/recipe engine composes a **fully
editable layered visual** (never a flat image), a human reviews and approves,
and it exports to PPTX/SVG (Canva/PowerPoint/Figma editable) with LinkedIn/
Buffer publishing as a future integration. The differentiators: editable
layered output, brand governance, human-in-the-loop gates, tenant isolation,
vendor-neutral internal design schema, and a licence-aware free-asset stack.

## 2. Repository & environment

- **Local path:** `C:\Documents\Application Data\Developments\Brandflow`
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/BrendenLogin0909/BrandFlow (branch `main`)
- **Monorepo (npm workspaces):**
  - `apps/api` — Fastify + Prisma + Postgres; ports/adapters; AI + asset providers
  - `apps/web` — React + Vite + Tailwind; the whole UI
  - `packages/design-schema` — InternalDesignDocument (Zod) + validation engine + text measurement
  - `packages/layout-recipes` — 8 recipes + variants + style directives + variety guard
  - `packages/exporters` — SVG + PPTX exporters, real Lucide icon artwork, charts
  - `packages/shared` — roles/capabilities, workflow state machine, LinkedIn presets
- **Dev stack:** Docker `postgres` (host port **5433**, not 5432) + `redis`; MinIO defined but storage not wired.
- **Run:** `docker compose up -d postgres redis` → `npm run dev:api` (:3001) → `npm run dev:web` (:5173).
  Test login: `alex@acme.test` / `supersecret123` (client "Acme Robotics", id `e3933542-…`).
- **Zero-setup demo:** `/playground` runs the whole design engine in the browser, no backend/keys.

## 3. AI providers (see apps/api/src/ai/)

- `AI_PROVIDER=anthropic|openai|mock` or auto-detect from keys; falls back to a **mock adapter** (labelled sample output) when no key — so every AI feature is testable offline.
- Currently the owner runs on an **OpenAI key** (in `apps/api/.env`, do not read/print it).
- Per-stage models via `ai/models.ts` + `AI_MODEL_IDEATION/DRAFT/FINAL/REVIEW`; OpenAI reasoning effort `low` (`AI_OPENAI_REASONING`) — gpt-5-class at default effort takes minutes.
- **Gotcha:** providers ignore `maxLength` in tool JSON-schemas → clamp AI string outputs in Zod (`.transform`), never hard-reject. And each prompt template needs a REAL JSON schema (empty placeholder → OpenAI returns empty args).

## 4. Current status by area

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Auth, multi-tenant routing, capability guard, audit | ✅ built, verified |
| Content-manager board (Buffer-style) | ✅ Ideas → Drafts → Review&planned → Approved → Rejected; items MOVE between columns; collapsible columns |
| Idea stage | ✅ AI batch suggest (tick-to-keep), expand-into-2-directions (grouped modal), inline edit, delete, brand-topic chips |
| Draft stage | ✅ one AI draft per idea; edit modal; directions (radio); **Storyboard** slide editor; original idea preserved as reference |
| Design stage (Recipe Playground) | ✅ 8 recipes×variants + style directives (two-tone headline, motifs incl. logo-top-left); brand colour/font pickers; Surprise-me; Save draft; **✨ Compose with AI** (freeform) |
| Freeform compose | ✅ AI invents full layout (icons/scenes/charts/arrows/colour-blocks); `autoFixFreeform` guarantees contrast+overflow; validation-gated with repair loop |
| Review & planned | ✅ Assign date (next-available / specific), Approve (Gate 3), both-set → Approved column |
| Design library | ✅ saved designs, filmstrip thumbnails, reopen exact |
| Export | ✅ PPTX (Canva-friendly) + SVG (zip for carousels), in-browser |
| Asset library | ✅ licence-aware search (icons/figures/photos/AI-gen), save to library/shared pool, approve/tier gate |
| Assets used by AI tool | ✅ compose auto-fills image placeholders from licensed providers + returns attributions |
| Dashboard, Calendar, Brand-profile UI, Review-queue page | ⏳ nav placeholders (data model + APIs mostly exist) |
| Object storage / customer upload (logos, photos) | ⏳ stubbed (StoragePort not wired to MinIO) |
| Polotno embedded editor | ⏳ needs free trial key `VITE_POLOTNO_KEY`; adapter + round-trip already built |
| Publish integration (LinkedIn/Buffer) | ⏳ not started (Approved cards say "integration TBC") |
| BullMQ queue workers | ⏳ AI runs synchronously; fine for single-user |

## 5. Free asset stack (licence-aware whitelist — NOT web search)

`apps/api/src/assets/registry.ts` (`PROVIDERS`, tiers 1/2/3, `AVOID_BY_DEFAULT`)
+ `providers.ts` (adapters). **Live with no keys:** Lucide (bundled icons),
Iconify (icon search), DiceBear (figures), **Openverse** (CC0/PDM photos),
Wikimedia (PD, review-tier), **Pollinations** (free AI image gen).
**Key-gated (light up when env key set):** Unsplash/Pexels/Pixabay stock,
OpenAI images. Every asset stores full provenance; tier-1 auto-usable,
tier 2–3 need a human tick. `AssetLibraryItem.clientCompanyId = null` = shared
pool reusable across clients.

## 6. Key architectural invariants (do not break)

1. **InternalDesignDocument is authoritative** (`packages/design-schema`). Polotno/PPTX/SVG are derived. Never let a vendor format become the source of truth.
2. **Validation gates everything visual** — nothing renders/exports with unresolved errors; recipes and freeform both pass through `validateDesignDocument`.
3. **Tenant isolation** — all content queries scoped by `clientCompanyId`; AI prompts assembled only via `buildBrandContext`; 404 (never 403) across tenants.
4. **Assets never used without provenance** — source whitelist only; tier gate before generation use.
5. **Editable layered output only** — the `no-raster-only` validation rule forbids flat-image designs.

## 7. Known gotchas (bit us before)

- After `prisma migrate`, the running API holds the old client → **stop API, `prisma generate`, restart** (Windows DLL lock otherwise).
- PowerShell here-string commit messages break on embedded double-quotes — use `git commit` via a bash heredoc, or avoid `"` in the message.
- JWT access token defaults to 15 min; dev `.env` sets `JWT_EXPIRY=12h`.
- Lucide-static roots carry the stroke/fill their paths inherit — icon paint attrs must live on the wrapper `<svg>`, or icons render invisible.
- tsx-watch restarts kill in-flight AI requests — check the pid in the API log when debugging a hang.

## 8. Backlog / next steps

See **[docs/16-backlog.md](16-backlog.md)** for the full parked list. Highest-value next:
1. **Google Fonts** in the playground (real brand typography — free, no key). *In progress when this doc was written.*
2. **unDraw** scene-illustration pack (bundle a manifest; hashed CDN URLs are unstable).
3. **Customer logo/photo upload** → StoragePort/MinIO → feeds logo-top-left motif.
4. **Attribution rendering** on export (compose already returns `attributions[]`).
5. **Manual asset insert** into a design in the playground (compose auto-fill works; manual drag does not yet).
6. Calendar page, Brand-profile editor UI, publish integration, queue workers.

## 9. Product-owner working style (important)

- Wants to **iterate in loops** (generate → critique → refine), not one-shot — especially on visual quality (benchmark: the **29FORWARD Australia** LinkedIn page — bold two-tone headlines, flat character illustrations, dynamic layered composition).
- Thinks in **Buffer.com** terms for the pipeline.
- Values: things actually *used* end-to-end (not just built), free/no-subscription where possible, and clear honesty about what's stubbed vs working.
